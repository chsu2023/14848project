Fall 2024 Notes: Class weekly Thursday 6:00-9:00 PM US ET; delivery mode is "Remote Only (REO)"; fully inverted model (primary lectures pre-recorded; weekly class meeting is for discussion and special presentations). Synchronous attendance at the on-line weekly class meeting is required for all class meetings. Class meetings will not be recorded under any circumstance.

We expect that Fall 2024 will be the last time this course will be offered, so if you want to take this course, this is the semester to take it!
